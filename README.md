- 👋 Hi, I’m @HashirSalam - Senior Software Engineer (React / Next.js)
- 👀 I am a full-stack software engineer, soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. I have experience using NextJs, ReactJS, Redux, Angular, Ionic, Javascript, Node.js, Flutter & Dart, and I've just started diving into lambda functions and S3 storage on AWS.

- I have worked with MERN, MEAN stack, NextJS, Jest, React Testing Library, Monorepos, TailwindCSS, and Storybook.
- I use Ionic and Flutter for hybrid mobile development (IOS / Android). 
- I have worked in Flask and Django frameworks (Python).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter as it seems pretty interesting piece of technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of web projects and also interested to work on ML projects to improve my python skills. 
- 📫 You can reach out to me here : hashersalam@gmail.com
